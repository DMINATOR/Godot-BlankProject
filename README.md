# Godot and SpecFlow sample project

## Overview

This is a simple empty project, created to demonstrate integration of:
* [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)
* [SpecFlow](https://specflow.org/)

## For this to work, the following changes have been made
1. SpecFlow is located separately, in order for Godot Mono not to pick it up automatically (or it will start complaigning)
2. Default Project created by Godot, was update to .Net 6 and C# language 10
